# Bachelors-thesis
The resulting Bachelor's Thesis during my internship at the BOKU Vienna.

I personally chose this topic from the catalogue of BOKU and analyzed the given data set using ANOVA-Models for the investigation of interaction effects between different variables and K-Means Clustering Algorithm for distinguishing women during fertile and non-fertile phase of their menstrual cycle. 

The work covers the application part of the mentioned methods, as well as the theoretical explanation and proofs of the ANOVA-Models and K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

The data is not allowed to be publicly shared, because it counts as a private property of BOKU. But the resulting work is allowed to be shared by me to add to my portfolio.
